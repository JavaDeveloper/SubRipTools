I'm through doing that shit.

- You sound like a duck.

- Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

10

do it again, you're never
gonna have to hear me quack.

- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

- Oh, yes !

- You're welcome.

14
00:01:11,884 --> 00:01:14,978
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:17,852
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16

Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17

Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:27,394
They're insured. Why should
they give a fuck ? I don't even
need a gun in a Federal bank.

19
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,924
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:33,972
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:37,600
"We got this guy's little girl.
If you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill her."

22

- Fuckin' right it worked.

not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

- Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl ?

25
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:54,853
There probably never was
a little girl. The point of
the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,919
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27

- You want to rob banks ?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

easier than what we've been doing.

-What've we been talkin' about ?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:10,742
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be. There's too many
foreigners own liquor stores.

don't even speak fuckin' English.

what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:17,181

fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:25,853
I don't want to either.
But they'll probably put us
in a situation where it's us or them.

when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

took the watch off,
put it in an old coffee can,

None of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive,

01:06:29,803 --> 01:06:33,000
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

969
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:38,306
your granddad asked
a gunner on an Air Force transport,

He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

ever saw the watch,

980
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:26,617
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

this watch was your birthright.

gonna put their greasy, yellow

he could hide something-- his ass.

he wore this watch up his ass.

I'm through.

- Don't worry, I will.

- Chill out, man !

went over a bump or somethin'.

-Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

gotta get it off the road, pronto.

I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1655

We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

- We ain't leavin'
'til we make a couple calls,

1658
01:57:17,623 --> 01:57:20,558
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch-- Jimmie's a friend.

1659

You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

Just tell him
not to be abusive.

1661
01:57:25,631 --> 01:57:27,565
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

Put yourself in his position--
It's 8:00 in the morning,
he just woke up.

He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1664

We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1665
01:57:35,874 --> 01:57:39,810
If that favor means I gotta
take shit, he can stick that
favor straight up his ass.

1666
01:57:39,878 --> 01:57:43,814
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd
you just do to his towel, man ?
- I was dryin' my hands !

1667
01:57:43,882 --> 01:57:46,817
- You're supposed to wash 'em first !
- You watched me wash 'em.

1668
01:57:46,885 --> 01:57:50,446
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em.
This shit's hard to get off.

1669
01:57:50,522 --> 01:57:52,456
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1670
01:57:52,524 --> 01:57:54,458
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,

1671
01:57:54,526 --> 01:57:57,461
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad !

1672
01:57:57,529 --> 01:58:00,464
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this ?

1673
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:04,628
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man !

But just don't put me

- Knock it off, Julie.

- I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.

I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1688

When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

1689

I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

But you know what's on
my mind right now ? It ain't
the coffee in my kitchen.

1691
01:58:55,854 --> 01:58:58,015
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

- Jimmie, don't even worry--
- Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

on the front of my house that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage" ?

see that sign ?

finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced ?

No trial separation.

- Uh-huh.

1761
02:02:55,454 --> 02:02:59,948
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here,
she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1762
02:03:00,025 --> 02:03:04,325
- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1763
02:03:04,397 --> 02:03:07,833
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1764
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:12,234
Now, you got a corpse
in a car, minus a head,
in a garage. Take me to it.

1765
02:03:16,275 --> 02:03:18,209
[ Sighs ]

1766
02:03:19,979 --> 02:03:21,913
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1767
02:03:21,981 --> 02:03:25,417
Do me a favor, will ya ? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1768
02:03:25,484 --> 02:03:28,920
- Would you make me a cup ?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

1769
02:03:30,389 --> 02:03:33,324
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it ?

1770
02:03:33,392 --> 02:03:35,952
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1771
02:03:38,030 --> 02:03:41,466
About the car, is there anything
I need to know ? Does it stall ?

1772
02:03:41,534 --> 02:03:44,970
Does it smoke ? Does it make
a lot of noise ? ls there gas in it ?

1773
02:03:45,037 --> 02:03:48,473
- Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.
- Positive ?

1774
02:03:48,541 --> 02:03:51,977
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1775
02:03:52,044 --> 02:03:56,105
- As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

1776
02:03:56,182 --> 02:03:58,207
Let's go back
to the kitchen.

1777
02:04:01,353 --> 02:04:03,787
[ Exhales ]

1778
02:04:03,856 --> 02:04:06,791
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1779
02:04:11,630 --> 02:04:13,564
Mmm.

1780
02:04:14,633 --> 02:04:16,760
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1781
02:04:16,836 --> 02:04:19,771
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1782
02:04:19,839 --> 02:04:22,569
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1783
02:04:22,641 --> 02:04:26,577
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.

1784
02:04:26,645 --> 02:04:30,081
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1785
02:04:30,149 --> 02:04:34,176
and clean the inside of the car--
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1786
02:04:34,253 --> 02:04:38,189
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1787
02:04:38,257 --> 02:04:41,192
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1788
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:44,195
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1789
02:04:44,263 --> 02:04:48,632
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

1790
02:04:48,701 --> 02:04:52,797
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1791
02:04:52,872 --> 02:04:55,306
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1792
02:04:55,374 --> 02:04:58,309
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1793
02:04:58,377 --> 02:05:02,006
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1794
02:05:02,081 --> 02:05:07,383
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1795
02:05:07,453 --> 02:05:09,387
with quilts and blankets,

1796
02:05:09,455 --> 02:05:13,391
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won't last,

1797
02:05:13,459 --> 02:05:16,326
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1798
02:05:16,395 --> 02:05:18,454
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1799
02:05:18,531 --> 02:05:20,294
"Please" would be nice.

1800
02:05:21,767 --> 02:05:24,702
- Come again ?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1801
02:05:26,605 --> 02:05:30,439
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1802
02:05:32,244 --> 02:05:35,179
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1803
02:05:35,247 --> 02:05:37,681
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1804
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:41,652
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1805
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:45,053
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1806
02:05:45,124 --> 02:05:48,059
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay ? I respect you.

1807
02:05:48,127 --> 02:05:50,925
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1808
02:05:50,996 --> 02:05:54,056
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1809
02:05:54,133 --> 02:05:58,763
I think fast, I talk fast,
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

1810
02:05:58,837 --> 02:06:02,273
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1811
02:06:06,779 --> 02:06:10,442
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right ? I can feel your look.

1812
02:06:13,152 --> 02:06:15,848
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1813

Green.

1815
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:24,395
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1816
02:06:26,599 --> 02:06:29,033
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1817
02:06:30,536 --> 02:06:32,470
Nobody who'll be missed.

1818
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:37,475
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1819
02:06:38,577 --> 02:06:40,511
- How we comin', Jimmie ?
- Pretty good.

1820
02:06:40,579 --> 02:06:43,742
- I got it all here, but, uh,
- [ Sighs ]

1821
02:06:43,816 --> 02:06:47,252
- Mr. Wolf,
you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1822
02:06:47,319 --> 02:06:50,846
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.

1823
02:06:50,923 --> 02:06:52,857
Uh-- Uh, no,
thank you.

1824
02:06:52,925 --> 02:06:56,053
Uh, this is
our best linen here,

1825
02:06:56,128 --> 02:06:59,063
and it's, uh--
it was a wedding present...

1826
02:06:59,131 --> 02:07:01,565
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1827
02:07:01,634 --> 02:07:06,071
- They're not with us anymore.
I wanna help--
- Let me ask you a question.

1828
02:07:06,138 --> 02:07:09,073
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.

1829
02:07:10,643 --> 02:07:15,546
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires ?

1830
02:07:16,682 --> 02:07:18,616
No.

1831
02:07:18,684 --> 02:07:21,118
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1832
02:07:21,186 --> 02:07:24,644
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1833
02:07:24,723 --> 02:07:27,157
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,

1834
02:07:27,226 --> 02:07:31,492
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1835
02:07:31,563 --> 02:07:34,691
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1836
02:07:38,671 --> 02:07:42,607
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1837
02:07:43,742 --> 02:07:45,676
How about you, Jimmie ?

1838
02:07:46,912 --> 02:07:48,846
You an oak man ?

1839
02:07:49,948 --> 02:07:51,882
Oak's nice.

Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1841
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:04,094
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1842
02:08:04,163 --> 02:08:07,599
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong...

1843
02:08:07,666 --> 02:08:10,601
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings ?

1844
02:08:10,669 --> 02:08:13,604
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit !

1845
02:08:13,672 --> 02:08:16,539
The motherfucker that said
that shit never had to pick up
itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1846
02:08:16,608 --> 02:08:20,374
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules,
for the abuse that I will take.

1847
02:08:20,446 --> 02:08:24,041
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1848
02:08:24,116 --> 02:08:27,552
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1849
02:08:27,619 --> 02:08:29,553
That's all.
I could blow.

1850
02:08:29,621 --> 02:08:31,555
- Oh, you ready to blow ?
- Yeah.

1851

am I doin' in the back ?

pickin' up this nigger's skull !

Fine job, gentlemen.

1858
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:03,854
You may get out of this yet.

1859

I can't believe
this is the same car.

1860

Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1861
02:09:09,928 --> 02:09:13,364
Phase one is complete-- Clean the car--
which moves us right along to Phase two:

1862
02:09:13,432 --> 02:09:15,366
Clean you two.

1863
02:09:16,935 --> 02:09:18,800

- All the way ?
- [ Wolf ] To your bare ass.

1865
02:09:22,708 --> 02:09:25,802
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1866
02:09:25,878 --> 02:09:28,813
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1867

Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1868

Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary ?

1869
02:09:33,537 --> 02:09:35,835
- You know what you two look like ?
- [ Vincent ] What ?

1870
02:09:35,906 --> 02:09:39,342
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1871
02:09:39,409 --> 02:09:42,776
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1872
02:09:47,084 --> 02:09:49,552
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1873
02:09:49,619 --> 02:09:54,056
Don't do nothin' stupid,
like leavin' this shit out front
for the garbageman to pick up.

1874
02:09:54,124 --> 02:09:58,356
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1875
02:09:59,796 --> 02:10:01,730
- Vincent.
- [ Wolf ] Okay, gentlemen.

1876
02:10:01,798 --> 02:10:05,290
You both been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

- Goddamn ! The water's fuckin' cold !
- Yo ! Yo ! Yo !

Better you than me, gentlemen.

- Get 'em there a little bit.
Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair !

1881
02:10:17,614 --> 02:10:20,515
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it ! Do it !
- Uh, um--

[ Wolf ] You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

[ Wolf Laughing ]
Perfect.

1885
02:10:40,604 --> 02:10:44,062
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1886
02:10:44,141 --> 02:10:46,075

What do they look like,
Jimmie ?

- Dorks. They look like
a couple of dorks.

- [ Both Laughing ]
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your
clothes, motherfucker.

1890
02:10:55,886 --> 02:10:58,616
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

1891
02:10:58,688 --> 02:11:00,622
Don't make me beg.

1892
02:11:03,693 --> 02:11:07,129
Okay, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

1893
02:11:07,197 --> 02:11:10,758
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1894
02:11:10,834 --> 02:11:13,769
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1895
02:11:13,837 --> 02:11:15,737
The place is North Hollywood,

1896
02:11:15,805 --> 02:11:19,798
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1897
02:11:19,876 --> 02:11:23,209
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1898
02:11:24,614 --> 02:11:26,548
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.

1899
02:11:26,616 --> 02:11:30,552
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1900
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:33,714
- nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something.

Get the fuck down. In the bag.

2042
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:48,095
- In the fucking bag !
- [ Customer ] I don't
have nothin' on me, man.

2043
02:19:48,163 --> 02:19:50,028
In the bag.

2044
02:19:50,098 --> 02:19:53,033
What am I waiting for ?
ln the fucking bag.

2045
02:19:53,101 --> 02:19:56,036
Laura. Laura. Tips.
In the bag.

2046
02:19:56,104 --> 02:19:58,334
- Is that a cellular phone ?
- Yeah.

2047
02:19:58,407 --> 02:20:00,341
In the fucking bag.

2048
02:20:01,910 --> 02:20:05,368
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

2049
02:20:05,447 --> 02:20:07,881
In the bag.
In the bag.

2050
02:20:20,062 --> 02:20:21,996
In the bag.

2051
02:20:37,112 --> 02:20:40,047
- What's in the case ?
- My boss's dirty laundry.

2052
02:20:40,115 --> 02:20:42,640
- Your boss makes you do his laundry ?
- When he wants it clean.

2053
02:20:42,718 --> 02:20:45,414
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

2054
02:20:45,487 --> 02:20:48,422
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

2055
02:20:50,459 --> 02:20:52,825
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

2056
02:20:53,895 --> 02:20:56,227
What's going on ?

2057
02:20:56,298 --> 02:20:59,756
- Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.
- Shoot him in the face !

2058
02:20:59,835 --> 02:21:03,566
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me.

2059
02:21:03,639 --> 02:21:07,040
- If you don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.
- Stop causing problems !

2060
02:21:07,109 --> 02:21:09,907
You'll get us all killed ! Give 'em
what you got and get 'em outta here !

2061
02:21:09,978 --> 02:21:14,210
Shut the fuck up, fat man ! This ain't
none of your goddamn business !

2062
02:21:14,283 --> 02:21:16,513
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.

2063
02:21:16,585 --> 02:21:18,678
No problem.
I got it under control.

2064
02:21:20,255 --> 02:21:22,246
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

2065
02:21:23,859 --> 02:21:27,795
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

2066
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:34,134
We clear ?

2067
02:21:37,272 --> 02:21:39,206
One.

2068
02:21:41,043 --> 02:21:43,568
Two.

2069
02:21:43,645 --> 02:21:45,704
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

2070
02:21:45,781 --> 02:21:47,840
You win.

2071
02:21:47,916 --> 02:21:49,850
It's yours.

2072
02:21:53,889 --> 02:21:56,619
- Open it.
- [ Latches Springing ]

2073
02:22:00,495 --> 02:22:02,725
[ Honey Bunny ]
Hey, what is it ?

2074
02:22:02,798 --> 02:22:05,130
What is it ?

2075
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:07,794
Is that what I think it is ?

2076
02:22:07,869 --> 02:22:10,565
Mm-hmm.

2077
02:22:12,140 --> 02:22:14,267
It's beautiful.

2078
02:22:14,343 --> 02:22:16,903
[ Giggling ]
Goddamn it, what is it ?

2079
02:22:18,380 --> 02:22:21,315
You let him go !
You let him go !

2080
02:22:21,383 --> 02:22:24,352
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you !
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

2081
02:22:24,419 --> 02:22:27,354
- Say, "Bitch, be cool !"
Say, "Bitch, be cool !"
- Be cool ! Be cool !

2082
02:22:27,422 --> 02:22:30,152
- Tell that bitch to chill !
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad !

2083
02:22:30,225 --> 02:22:33,126
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out !
- Chill out, Honey Bunny !

2084
02:22:33,195 --> 02:22:34,992
- Let go of him !
- Chill out, Honey Bunny !

2085
02:22:35,063 --> 02:22:37,998
- Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right !
- I promise !

2086
02:22:38,066 --> 02:22:39,966
- Tell her to chill !
- Chill out, Honey Bunny !

2087
02:22:40,035 --> 02:22:41,969
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2088
02:22:42,037 --> 02:22:45,473
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we ?

2089
02:22:45,540 --> 02:22:48,475
- Don't you hurt him !
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody !

2090
02:22:48,543 --> 02:22:52,035
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like ?

2091
02:22:52,114 --> 02:22:55,777
- Come on, Yolanda !
What's Fonzie like ?
- He's cool.

2092
02:22:55,851 --> 02:22:57,785
- What ?
- Cool.

2093
02:22:57,853 --> 02:23:00,686
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

2094
02:23:00,756 --> 02:23:02,690
We're gonna be cool.

2095
02:23:02,758 --> 02:23:07,661
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2096
02:23:07,729 --> 02:23:09,822
And when I count three,

2097
02:23:09,898 --> 02:23:12,833
I want you to
let go of your gun,

2098
02:23:12,901 --> 02:23:16,359
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

2099
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:19,498
And when you do it,

2100
02:23:19,574 --> 02:23:21,633
you do it cool.

2101
02:23:21,710 --> 02:23:24,042
You ready ?

2102
02:23:24,112 --> 02:23:26,205
One,

2103
02:23:26,281 --> 02:23:28,476
two,

2104
02:23:28,550 --> 02:23:30,484
three.

2105
02:23:37,459 --> 02:23:40,587
- [ Panting ] Okay, now you let him go !
- Yolanda !

2106
02:23:40,662 --> 02:23:44,257
I thought you were gonna
be cool. Now, when you yell
at me, it makes me nervous.

2107
02:23:44,332 --> 02:23:46,425
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

2108
02:23:46,501 --> 02:23:50,335
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

2109
02:23:51,973 --> 02:23:55,602
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

2110
02:23:55,677 --> 02:23:59,078
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

2111
02:23:59,147 --> 02:24:01,081
But I don't want that.

2112
02:24:01,149 --> 02:24:03,083
And you don't want that.

2113
02:24:03,151 --> 02:24:05,881
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2114
02:24:05,954 --> 02:24:08,047
So let's see what we can do.

2115
02:24:10,459 --> 02:24:13,690
Now... here's the situation.

2116
02:24:13,762 --> 02:24:17,630
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

2117
02:24:17,699 --> 02:24:21,135
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

2118
02:24:21,203 --> 02:24:24,138
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

2119
02:24:24,206 --> 02:24:28,142
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2120
02:24:28,210 --> 02:24:31,145
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

2121
02:24:31,213 --> 02:24:34,148
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2122
02:24:34,216 --> 02:24:36,081
- Vincent !
- [ Yells ]

2123
02:24:36,151 --> 02:24:39,086
- Be cool ! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back !

2124
02:24:39,154 --> 02:24:41,850
It's cool !
We still just talkin'.

2125
02:24:41,923 --> 02:24:46,087
- Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me. There you go.
- [ Yolanda Whimpering ]

2126
02:24:46,161 --> 02:24:48,220
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

2127
02:24:48,296 --> 02:24:50,230
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

2128
02:24:50,298 --> 02:24:52,232
Tell her it's still cool.

2129
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:55,235
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby ?

2130
02:24:56,638 --> 02:24:59,300
I-- I gotta go pee.

2131
02:24:59,374 --> 02:25:01,308
I wanna go home.

2132
02:25:01,376 --> 02:25:04,971
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

2133
02:25:05,046 --> 02:25:07,981
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

2134
02:25:08,049 --> 02:25:11,416
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

2135
02:25:11,486 --> 02:25:14,649
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

2136
02:25:14,723 --> 02:25:18,659
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

2137
02:25:21,196 --> 02:25:25,132
- Which one is it ?
- It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

2138
02:25:39,393 --> 02:25:41,953
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

2139
02:25:42,029 --> 02:25:45,123
Open it up.
Take out the money.

2140
02:25:50,170 --> 02:25:52,331
[ Jules ]
Count it.

2141
02:25:58,645 --> 02:26:01,170
How much is there ?

2142
02:26:03,083 --> 02:26:05,017
About 1,500 dollars.

2143
02:26:05,085 --> 02:26:08,282
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2144
02:26:08,355 --> 02:26:11,552
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

2145
02:26:11,625 --> 02:26:13,718
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh ?

2146
02:26:13,794 --> 02:26:17,696
Jules, you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll
shoot him on general principle.

2147
02:26:17,765 --> 02:26:21,201
No, Yolanda ! Yolanda ! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing !

2148
02:26:21,268 --> 02:26:23,361
Vince, shut the fuck up !

2149
02:26:23,437 --> 02:26:27,305
- Shut up !
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

2150
02:26:27,374 --> 02:26:30,309
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

2151
02:26:30,377 --> 02:26:32,311
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

2152
02:26:33,547 --> 02:26:36,744
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo ?
- What ?

2153
02:26:36,817 --> 02:26:41,550
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2154
02:26:41,622 --> 02:26:44,318
You read the Bible, Ringo ?

2155
02:26:45,392 --> 02:26:47,326
Not regularly, no.

2156
02:26:47,394 --> 02:26:49,828
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2157
02:26:49,897 --> 02:26:53,424
Ezekiel 25:17.

2158
02:26:53,500 --> 02:26:56,333
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2159
02:26:56,403 --> 02:26:58,337
by the inequities
of the selfish...

2160
02:26:58,405 --> 02:27:00,339
and the tyranny of evil men.

2161
02:27:00,407 --> 02:27:03,774
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

2162
02:27:03,844 --> 02:27:06,278
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2163
02:27:06,346 --> 02:27:10,442
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2164
02:27:10,517 --> 02:27:14,817
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2165
02:27:14,888 --> 02:27:17,948
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2166
02:27:18,025 --> 02:27:21,051
And you will know
I am the Lord...

2167
02:27:21,128 --> 02:27:24,689
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2168
02:27:25,766 --> 02:27:28,200
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2169
02:27:28,268 --> 02:27:31,431
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2170
02:27:31,505 --> 02:27:34,440
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2171
02:27:34,508 --> 02:27:37,443
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2172
02:27:37,511 --> 02:27:39,945
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2173
02:27:40,013 --> 02:27:43,449
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2174
02:27:43,517 --> 02:27:46,452
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2175
02:27:46,520 --> 02:27:51,389
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2176
02:27:51,458 --> 02:27:54,393
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2177
02:27:54,461 --> 02:27:58,022
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2178
02:27:58,098 --> 02:28:00,032
Or it could mean...

2179
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:03,536
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2180
02:28:03,604 --> 02:28:07,540
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2181
02:28:07,608 --> 02:28:09,872
Now, I'd like that.

2182
02:28:09,943 --> 02:28:12,844
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2183
02:28:12,913 --> 02:28:14,778
The truth is,

2184
02:28:15,849 --> 02:28:17,783
you're the weak...

2185
02:28:19,186 --> 02:28:22,587
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2186
02:28:23,991 --> 02:28:25,925
